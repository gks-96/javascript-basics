/*
 Javascript is a
 high-level : developer does not have to worry about resource management or hardware interaction

 garbage collected - automatically cleans the memory

 interpreted or just-in-time (JIT): not clear

paradigm:
procedural , oop , and functional programming

prototype-based object oriented -> ( array prototype already exists)

first-class functions _ we can pass them as variables, we can pass them into other functions
and return from other functions

dynamically typed - we dont define the types

( javascript with types -> typescript )

single-threaded

non-blocking event loop


JS Engine: Program that executed javascript code
( all the browsers have their own javascript engines )
